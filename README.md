# Scoring
Application is built using React.js.

List items have pre-defined names and score attributes that start at 0.

The position attribute represents the position within the list.

TOGLLE FORM button randomly generates form with items from list, inputs, and submit button. 

SUBMIT button enables list item with higher value to have its score attribute value increased by one.

List is after that sorted by the value of the score attribute. 

This process continues until every item is compared with every other item in the list.
